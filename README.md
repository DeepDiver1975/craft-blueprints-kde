# Branches

- `master`: update to existing stuff goes here (only supports Qt6)
- `dev`: ... unless it has chance of breaking everything and the kitchen sink then it goes here. Also, new caches go here. Only supports Qt6.
- `qt5-lts`: branch to continue support for Qt5, no major updates are expected here
